# LR-Web

This project was initially designed as a rough proof of concept for a GCSE DT project. It does not work and shows my at the time laughable web-dev skills.


This is a small **very** indev full front and backend for connecting a Pi host to a slave with LoRa modules allowing a client to connect to the slave and send email to the master and from that to the internet.
